## About

Art is one of the few languages which transcends barriers of country, culture, and time. We aim to create an algorithm that can help discover the common semantic elements of art even between **any** culture, media, artist, or collection within the combined artworks of [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/) and [The Rijksmusem](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en). 

### Conditional Image Retrieval

<p align="center">

</p>

Image retrieval systems allow individuals to find images that are semantically similar to a query image. This serves as the backbone of reverse image search engines and many product recommendation engines. 
We present a novel method for specializing image retrieval systems called conditional image retrieval. When applied over large art datasets, conditional image retrieval provides visual analogies that bring to light hidden connections among different artists, cultures, and media. Conditional image retrieval systems can efficiently find shared semantics between works of vastly different media and cultural origin. [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07177) introduces new variants of K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms that support specializing to particular subsets of image collections on the fly. 

### Deep Semantic Similarity

To find artworks with similar semantic structure we leverage "features" from deep vision networks trained on ImageNet. These networks map images into a high-dimensional space where distance is semantically meaningful. Here, nearest neighbor queries tend to act as "reverse image search engines" and similar objects often share common structure.

 The MIT x MSFT externs were pivotal in turning this research project into a functioning website. In only one month, the team built and designed the mosaic website. Stephanie Fu and Mindren Lu also contributed to the "Conditional Image Retrieval" publication through their evaluation of the affect of different pre-trained networks on nonparametric style transfer.
